## Example of Running Ponzu with Docker

This docker-compose contains 2 docker containers:

1. web - a basic nginx front end, with Javascript ajax accessing the /api
2. admin - an example ponzu container

The admin contain is based on the official [Ponzu Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ponzu/ponzu/)

### Running the example

```bash
# build the containers
docker-compose build

#start the containers in the background
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Then follow these steps:
1. Visit the http://localhost:3000/admin to configure Ponzu.
2. Add several songs http://localhost:3000/admin/contents?type=Song
3. Visit http://localhost:3000/ to see the rest service accessed via AJAX

Stop the containers:
```
docker-compose stop
```

### Web Container

This nginx web container takes any incoming requests and if it matches `/api*` or `/admin*` it will then route it to the exposed ports :8080 on the ponzu container

### Ponzu - Admin Container

The ponzu container has a small [startup script](./admin/start_admin_.sh) which symlinks and logs or database files into a Docker Volume. If you need access to the ponzu logs, it is exposed a Volume.

#### Accessing the Ponzu terminal in Development

Make sure you have no running docker images `docker ps`. Then use the following command to start an interactive shell into the docker container.

```bash
# make sure the containers are built
docker-compose build

# start and tty into the container
docker run -v $(pwd)/admin:/go/src/project -it docker_admin

# run a ponzu command
ponzu generate content message title:"string" description:"string"
```

After the above generate command `message.go` content type is now available in your local filesystem. Use `docker-compose build` then `docker-compose up -d` to see the new model in the admin.
